This project took advantage of CMake software developed by Kitware, LAPACK software \cite{Anderson99}, MPI software, and netCDF software developed by UCAR/Unidata (\href{http://doi.org/10.5065/D6H70CW6}{http://doi.org/ 10.5065/D6H70CW6}). This work was funded by the Department of Energy's Computational Science Graduate Fellowship, under grant number DE-SC0020347. We would also like to acknowledge Samuel Stechmann for advising the development of this simulator, and Nelia Mann for insight into debugging some features.
