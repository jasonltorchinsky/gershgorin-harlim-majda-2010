In this appendix, we will be deriving the pathwise solutions for the Gershgorin-Harlim-Majda 2010 system. The first subsection will provide various identities used throughout the derivations for the pathwise solutions, while subsequent subsections will include the derivations for individual pathwise solutions. We assume that the initial values of $\func{b}{t}$, $\func{\gamma}{t}$ and $\func{u}{t}$ are given.

For ease of reference, we give the equation numbers for each of the pathwise solutions below:

\begin{itemize}
	\item [] $\func{b}{t}$ -- Eq.~\ref{eqn:pathwise_b}.
	\item [] $\func{\gamma}{t}$ -- Eq.~\ref{eqn:pathwise_gamma}.
	\item [] $\func{u}{t}$ -- Eq.~\ref{eqn:pathwise_u}.
\end{itemize}
