In the most overview sense, the simulation code contains a single driver subroutine that calls subroutines to perform the following tasks:
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
	\item Initialize the simulation, including reading the \texttt{NAMELIST}.
	\item Execute the simulation.
	\item Finalize the simulation.
\end{enumerate}
