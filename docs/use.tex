This code utilizes CMake as a build system, and was designed for compilation on Ubuntu 20.04.1. In particular, here are the requirements for compiling and running the code:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \href{https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake}{CMake} (at least version 3.16).
	\item \href{https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-fortran}{netCDF-Fortran} (at least version 4.8.0).
\end{itemize}

Once you have these, simply navigate to the \texttt{build} subdirectory and enter the standard CMake commands
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
	cmake ..
	cmake --build .
\end{lstlisting}

This will compile the code, build the headers and \texttt{NAMELIST}, and create the executable \texttt{gershgorin\_majda\_10}. To run the code, enter the command
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
	./gershgorin_majda_10
\end{lstlisting}
and an output file \texttt{out.nc} will be generated.
