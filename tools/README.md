# `tools`

This subdirectory contains a collection of Python scripts used to generate plots of some of the statistics for the Gershgorin-Harlim-Majda 2010 system. These scripts depend on the following Python libraries:
	- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html) (at least version 3.3.4).
	- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) (at least version 1.20.0).
	- [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) (at least version 1.6.0).
	- [Xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/) (at least version 0.16.2).

To run these scripts, simply run the `main.py` script with
```
	python main.py
```

Note: I am very new to coding in Python and, in addition to ending this sub-project prematurely, has resulted in scripts that may be inefficient and sloppy. We apologize for this inconvenience, and hope that we may someday return to this project to imporve it.
